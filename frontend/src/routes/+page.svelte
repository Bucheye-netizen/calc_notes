I built this site to achieve two goals: 
</p>

<ul>
   <li> Provide a thorough resource for learning and practicing calculus </li>
   <li> As a learning experience for my self </li>
</ul>

<p>
The website is organized into notes, each covering a unique topic within the field of calculus. Every note has a list of prerequisite topics that can be navigated to through the graph view. 
</p>

<p>
I was inspired to build this project by Obsidian and other graph-based note taking systems.
